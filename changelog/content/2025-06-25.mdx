## Major Refactoring & Dependency Cleanup

I decided to strip down the app to focus purely on the experimental side. Removed hCaptcha and PostHog since they were adding complexity for what's essentially a testing playground. Deleted the settings and boards routes too they felt like overkill for just testing models quickly. Built a new modular sidebar system under `src/components/app-sidebar` that's much cleaner.

API key management is now handled locally or through Convex, which makes more sense for a BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) approach. Created new components for API key management and settings that are actually needed for the core functionality. Updated the README and `.env.example` to reflect this simpler setup.

Also added Fumadocs for changelog documentation (like this one!). Refactored the chat components and removed some unused stuff like message-versions and regenerate-dropdown that were cluttering the codebase. Will add a simpler way to do message versioning. The sidebar and history sections are much cleaner now.

Need to also fix logic for logged in users, but for now focusing on non logged in user flow, to keep the app fast and smooth.

Special thanks to the T3 community and the following developers who inspired this project:

- **[@theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg)** - T3 chat cloneathon and AI SDK guidance
- **[@Ibelick](https://twitter.com/ibelick)** - Zola chat implementation and prompt kit
- **[@r_marked](https://twitter.com/r_marked)** - Competition and review process
- **[@t3dotchat](https://twitter.com/t3dotchat)** - Setting the standard for daily chat applications

This version represents a significant shift in the project's direction, moving from a general-purpose chat application to a specialized experimental platform for AI model testing and comparison.
